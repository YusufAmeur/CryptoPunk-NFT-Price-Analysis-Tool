# Digital Futures Capstone Project: Cryptopunk Price Analytical Tool.

The following outlines the capstone project I completed to end my time at the Digital Futures Academy.

# Project Aims

This Capstone project aimed to create a summative reflection of the skills acquired at the Digital Futures Academy. 
The overall aim of the project was to build a mechanism that would ease the NFT trading experience, potentially aiding the identification of underpriced Non-fungible tokens (NFT) within different marketplaces.
To date, very few analytical tools are readily available within the Cryptocurrency/NFT space, making NFT trading exclusionary to the average consumer. This project sought to address just that, creating an Analytical tool that, given an input of key features and factors, returns a prediction on the current value of an NFT (Ethereum). 
The poster NFT of the space, Cryptopunks, was the focus of this project, simply due to being the most popular token as of late.
Due to being the first of its kind, this project presents an exciting opportunity to aid and subsequently pioneer the blockchain space.

# Why is a Price Analytical Tool Necessary? 

1. Trading NFTs can be extremely profitable
2. No two CryptoPunks are alike, thus vary in price
3. Identifying potential buy-in periods can be difficult
4. No project-specific predictive tool is currently available

# Dataset Acquisition

To build a system that can take user input of the different traits of Cryptopunks, it was vital to secure a stable dataset where data for each of NFT were available. 
Luckily, I was able to find a Kaggle dataset that had been web scraped from a previous year.

# Approach Overview

# Limitations

Due to the dataset being not up to date, this project is not entirely reflective of the current markets. It is heavily advised for this project to be built upon, ideally using up-to-
date data from different marketplaces. This can be done by gaining permission to the different marketplace APIs.

# Future Direction 

Being the first of its kind, this tool has a lot of room for improvement. We have enlisted a few points to start below:

- Application of NFT price analysis tool to concurrent CryptoPunk transaction data 

- Inclusion of more indepth price influencing factors including potential social ecosystem data, these include:

1. Status of the Cryptocurrency market
2. Status of the NFT market
3. Who is the seller? (Do they own multiple NFTs?)

- Application of price analysis tool to other NFT projects. There are a whole plethora of different NFT projects out there, in which this tool can be used as the blueprint in creating a tool for whatever dataset necessary
